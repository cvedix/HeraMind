# System Information & Infrastructure

`heramind system info` returns the HeraMind system/infrastructure details a user needs when connecting devices or asking for broker/network/server info.

## CRITICAL Rules

1. **RUN `heramind system info` yourself and report its actual output — do NOT just tell the user to run it, and do NOT narrate steps.** When the user wants the broker address / port / network info (e.g. to connect an ESP32/edge device via MQTT), the answer is one command: `heramind system info`. Execute it and summarize the result.
2. **`heramind system info` is the source of truth for the ACTIVE broker/network — NOT `heramind connector list`.** `connector list` shows *external* broker subscriptions the user configured; it does NOT return the built-in broker address/port/network the user needs to connect a device. For "what's the broker address / how do I connect" → `heramind system info`.
3. **Use `heramind system info` — NOT raw OS commands** (`ipconfig`, `ip a`, `ifconfig`, `hostname`). OS commands do NOT know the HeraMind broker/webhook config and may be blocked by the sandbox.
4. **`heramind system info` returns**: MQTT broker address + port + protocol (`mqtt://` or `mqtts://`), TLS status, auth status + credentials, webhook URL (for HTTP devices), network info (server IP, WiFi SSID), and device connection details (topics, payload formats).
5. **The only subcommand under `heramind system` is `info`.** Timezone and data retention are NOT here — they live under `heramind settings` (see the `settings-management` skill).

## Command Reference

### Show system info

```bash
heramind system info
```

Returns: MQTT broker (host/port/protocol), TLS status, auth status + credentials, webhook URL, network info (server IP, WiFi SSID), device connection topics/payload formats.

Use this whenever the user asks for: broker address, how to connect a device, server/network info, webhook URL, system status, or "what's the system setup".
