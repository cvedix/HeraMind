"""Hard signals — deterministic pass/fail metrics computed from a CaseRecord.

These are the RELIABLE eval signals. The LLM judge (judge.py) is soft and prone
to score inflation; per project calibration (2026-07-20) the trustworthy signals
are hard assertion/substring matches + manual testing, NOT the judge's weighted
grade.

Two complementary hard signals (each covers a gap the other can't):
  - state_query pass : did the world change correctly?   (mutation cases)
  - tool_match       : did the agent call the right tool/command? (all, esp. reads)
Plus wrong_tool : did the agent grab a clearly-wrong tool — the MiniCPM5-1B
failure mode (file_write/web_fetch instead of shell→heramind)?

compute() is PURE: given a case dict + a CaseRecord dict it returns a `hard`
block. No server, no LLM. So it works retroactively on existing runs'
cases.jsonl and runs judge-free (which means free local-model iteration — the
local model costs nothing to run; only the judge costs money).

Case schema addition (optional, backward-compatible):
    "expect": {"tools": ["shell"], "commands": ["heramind device types list"]}
When absent, expected tools/commands are auto-derived from backtick
`heramind ...` commands and action verbs in the case text (flagged `derived`).
